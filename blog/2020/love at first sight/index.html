                        lert! Do not think you will get a beautiful life partner by reading this article (if you get,
                        then congratulation to you). But what you will perceive from here? Okay, it will increase your
                        chance to have a beautiful life partner and probably gives an insight into how to extract
                        information from data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dates with people are a great way to see what type of person you attracted to. Is there
                        something to get potential dates partner. I found a <a
                            href="https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment">dataset</a> that will
                        help to explore this
                        question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before exploring the dataset, we need to know a little bit about this dataset. Data was gathered
                        from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004 which was conducted by the
                        University of Columbia. During the events, the attendees would have a four-minute "first date"
                        with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants
                        were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date
                        on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
                    </p>
                    <h4>letâ€™s dive into it</h4>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/1.png" alt="" /></p>
                    <p>
                        At first have a look at the data. In this dataset has 8378 data samples with 195 features for
                        each data sample.
                        The first 3 samples of the dataset are,
                    </p>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/2.png" alt="" /></p>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/3.png" alt="" />
                    <P>
                        From the above image, we can see there are lots of missing values. As the dataset is small only
                        8378 datapoints, in each datapoint maximum fields are NaNs in that it is not a good idea to
                        delete all of the missing value fields, or probably bad practice to use imputation to guess the
                        values rather than we can remove those columns from the dataset where more than 4000 values are
                        NaNs.
                    </P>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/4.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        So we have got 130 attributes for each data sample after removing those columns which have more
                        than 4000 value are NaNs. Our aim is to find how many people got to the second date after the
                        first-speed dating session.
                    </p>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/5.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        Less than 20% participant who actually got the decision to go the second date. Let us dig more
                        to find out what qualities they have considered (vice-versa) of their partners to take the
                        second date decision. Okay, try to extract a little bit more information from them.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">. . .</p>
                    <h4>What is their race?</h4>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/6.png" alt="" />
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/7.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        Here we can see that most of the people who are willing to go to the second date most of them
                        are Caucasian-American. It could either be a cultural thing or this event are were organized in
                        a specific area with this demographic.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">. . .</p>
                    <h4>let's check the ethnicity of those matched people</h4>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/8.png" alt="" />
                    <p>We find out that most of the people who got the second date were not the same ethnicity.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">. . .</p>
                    <h4>What's the age of participants in this event?</h4>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/9.png" alt="" />
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/10.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        If we see the age distribution of those participants, most of the participants were from 20 to
                        30. Do not worry if you are more than 30, there is a relatively small chance for you as age
                        distribution is not zero after 30. So go for it.
                    </p>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/11.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        We are reassured from this histogram that most of the participants' ages range between 20 to 30.
                        But if we consider after 30 number of the females is greater than male Interesting ðŸ™‚.
                    </p>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/12.png" alt="" />
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/13.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        For this plot, we can observe that "African American" females are a little bit older
                        than male counterpart but we can see the opposite trend for every other race.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">. . .</p>
                    <h4>Now see about their intended career?</h4>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/14.png" alt="" />
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/15.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        If you are doing Business, Economics, Finance, or even Biological science, physics, or chemistry
                        Hats off to you guys. A small number of engineers went to the second step in the speed dating
                        event. The main reason may be engineers tend to devote most of their time building things than
                        relationships ðŸ™„
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">. . .</p>
                    <p>
                        Now let's just for fun think about an attribute why people participating in this first date
                        events.
                    </p>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/16.png" alt="" />
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/17.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        From this counterplot, we find out the majority of the people in this competition who did match
                        out to either meet new people or just felt that it would be a fun night out. The limited number
                        of people go out of this event for a serious relationship, respect for those people.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">. . .</p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, they rate themselves how they thought others would rate them on each of the following
                        attributes, on a scale of 1-10 (1=awful, 10=great). let's think about that feature
                    </p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                        <li>attr5_1 - > Attractive</li>
                        <li>sinc5_1 - > Sincere</li>
                        <li>int5_1 - >Intelligent</li>
                        <li>fun5_1 - >Fun</li>
                        <li>amb5_1 - > Ambitious</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/18.png" alt="" />
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/19.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        Wow <span>ðŸ˜²</span>, that is interesting, if we observe these five plots that a large number of
                        people are confident about themselves. Awesome! Confidence is everything to get some great
                        outcomes. So be confident.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">. . .</p>

                    <h4>In which activities are they interested?</h4>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/20.png" alt="" />
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/21.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        If we see the participants' interest, most people like to eat, read, and watching movies.
                        See below the heat map for male and female interest specifically.
                    </p>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/22.png" alt="" />
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/23.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        we notice that not surprisingly liking art comes with liking museums, liking music with liking
                        concerts, and liking sports with liking watching sports (but not a strong correlation with
                        liking exercises for male participants). Also, theater and art correlation seem to be different
                        for male and female participants.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">. . .</p>
                    <h4>Unrequited love count</h4>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/24.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        unfortunately, more than 25% of participants were heartbroken which is more than the percentage
                        of people who got a second date. I do not know unrequited love is real love or not but one
                        person is attractive, ambitious, funny, successful - does not mean that he/she is necessarily a
                        great guy for you.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold">. . .</p>
                    <p>Let's see some factors that can help to understand why people fall in love.</p>
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/25.png" alt="" />
                    <p><img src="/assets/img/jun-2020/26.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        In this bar chart, we find out men want their partner to be quite attractive but women do not
                        consider attractiveness as the main factor to choose a partner. Nevertheless, women also look
                        for sincere, intelligent, and ambitious mates more than what men look for in women.
                    </p>
